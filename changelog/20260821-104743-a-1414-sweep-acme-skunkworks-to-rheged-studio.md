## Changed

**Sweep remaining @acme-skunkworks identifiers to @rheged-studio ([A-1414](https://linear.app/rheged-studio/issue/A-1414))**

- Migrate npm dependency keys, config extends, skill package names, and docs to `@rheged-studio/*`
- Refresh lockfile to resolve published bootstrap packages on npm
- Second-pass brand prose sweep where A-1220 missed
